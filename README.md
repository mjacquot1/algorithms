# algorithms
My notes and cheat sheets for algorithms.

**Arrays/Strings**
1. If it says longest/shortest of sub string/array, its a sliding window problem
2. If it says "Pattern of length k", its a sliding window problem
3. Buy/Sell stock is a sliding window problem
4. If it says "find more than 2 values that equal x" its probably a 2 pointer
5. Two pointers usually starts at (l_point, r_point = 0, len(arr)-1). But not always

**Graphs**
1. If it says "nodes from 0 to n", consider Union Joins.
